# churn_project
<h1>Udacity project.</h1>

To run this project you will need Pything 3.x. You will also need to import the following libraries:
* seaborn
* scikitlearn
* numpy
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

All data used for this is located in the /data directory within this repository. The original data is 
from Kaggle and a link to the data is provided in the notebook. 

<h3>Files</h3>
There is only one file in the project labeled churn_project.ipynb. 

<h3>Summary</h3>


<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
Throughout this project I used articles and resources from several blog posts all available on-line. 
These articles are called out in the churn file as well as reproduced here. 
<h4>Data</h4>
* The original dataset was taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/radmirzosimov/telecom-users-dataset">Kaggle</a>

<h4>Chosing a model</h4>
* <a href='https://towardsdatascience.com/all-machine-learning-models-explained-in-6-minutes-9fe30ff6776a'>All Machine Learning Models Explained in 6 Minutes</a>: This article served as a primer for determining which models to chose. This blog is available on towards data science. 
* <a href='https://towardsdatascience.com/which-machine-learning-model-to-use-db5fdf37f3dd'>Which machine learning model to use?</a>: Another nice article on chosing models to suit the purpose. 
* <a href='https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/'>4 Types of Classification Tasks in Machine Learning</a>: In addition to describing Classification, this article also describes which models are best fit for the differing Classification needs.

<h4>Understanding Model Performance</h4>
* < href='https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-confusion-matrix-and-how-to-implement-it-in-python-319202e0fe4d'>Understanding the Confusion Matrix and How to Implement it in Python</a>: This article serves as a good primer on how to read and draw conclusions from a Confusion Matrix. In addition, I use an image taken from that article to help readers understand what they are seeing.
