# churn_project
<h1>Udacity project.</h1>

To run this project you will need Pything 3.x. You will also need to import the following libraries:
* seaborn
* scikitlearn
* numpy
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib

All data used for this is located in the /data directory within this repository. The original data is 
from Kaggle and a link to the data is provided in the notebook. 

<h3>Files</h3>
There is only one file in the project labeled churn_project.ipynb. This file contains all of our Python code, explanations of what considerations and decisions we are making during out work, as well as links to external sources of information and explanations used in the course of this project.

<h3>Summary</h3>


<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
Throughout this project I used articles and resources from several blog posts all available on-line. Those articles which provided the most help are specifically highlighted below. These articles are called out in the churn file where appropriate as well as reproduced here. This is not an exhastive list and there are links to additional information provided for in the churn_project notebook. 

<h4>Data</h4>
The original dataset was taken from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/radmirzosimov/telecom-users-dataset">Telecom users dataset</a> available on Kaggle.


<h4>Chosing a model</h4>
* <a href='https://towardsdatascience.com/all-machine-learning-models-explained-in-6-minutes-9fe30ff6776a'>All Machine Learning Models Explained in 6 Minutes</a>: This article served as a primer for determining which models to chose. This blog is available on towards data science.

* <a href='https://towardsdatascience.com/which-machine-learning-model-to-use-db5fdf37f3dd'>Which machine learning model to use?</a>: Another nice article on chosing models to suit the purpose.

* <a href='https://machinelearningmastery.com/types-of-classification-in-machine-learning/'>4 Types of Classification Tasks in Machine Learning</a>: In addition to describing Classification, this article also describes which models are best fit for the differing Classification needs.

<h4>Understanding Model Performance</h4>
* <a href='https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-confusion-matrix-and-how-to-implement-it-in-python-319202e0fe4d'>Understanding the Confusion Matrix and How to Implement it in Python</a>: This article serves as a good primer on how to read and draw conclusions from a Confusion Matrix. In addition, I use an image taken from that article to help readers understand what they are seeing.
